Hi there 👋🏼! I'm an electronic engineer with passion for software. I'm particularly skilled in (but not limited to) Python, Dart and Java but always eager to learn and expand my knowledge. 
I believe languages are tools to create a product - so i can adapt to any language.

Currently, I'm focusing on the fascinating world of AI, specifically multi-agent AI. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and expand my knowledge in this field.

In addition to programming, I enjoy travelling, game-viewing, gaming and reading. Nature provides a peaceful and serene environment that can help us think creatively and improve our overall well-being.

WCE (WhatsApp ChatBot Engine) is the last project I began working on. It's a framework library in `Java` & `Python` to build chatbots using a template-driven approach. I figured most `WhatsApp` projects out there are either just client libraries, uses web automation or basic `if..else` for demonstrating. This is a full-blown framework to create chatbots of any scale for you. 
It is accessible and has a lot of potential so I suggest you take a look at it!

LogBook is a windows desktop app created with `Flutter`. It was created during my internship year to help me log and keep track of my internship progress.
The goal was to easily use my eLogBook inorder to complete my University log book needed after my internship year.
